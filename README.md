Deployment notes
Local (test)

npm install

Copy .env.example → .env and fill MEGA credentials.

node server.js (or npm run dev with nodemon)

Open http://localhost:3000

Render

Create a Web Service on Render.

Repo: push project to GitHub and connect Render.

Build command: npm install

Start command: npm start

Set environment variables in Render dashboard (MEGA_EMAIL, MEGA_PASS, PORT optional).

Ensure Node version >=18 in engines in package.json.

Heroku

Heroku free dynos deprecated — if you use paid dyno, do:

git push heroku main

Set ENV vars in Heroku dashboard.

Procfile not required as npm start will run. If needed, add Procfile: web: npm start.

Vercel

Vercel is primarily for frontend. To deploy this Node server on Vercel you'd need to use a Serverless Function (Vercel supports Node API routes) — not recommended for long-lived WebSocket-like connections Baileys needs. So:

Use Render / Railway / Fly / Heroku (paid dyno) for this project.

If you insist on Vercel, you'd need to adapt to serverless and store creds differently (not covered here).

Important operational notes & tips

This service does not include any bot logic — it only generates Sila~<code> sessions. Use that Sila~... code in your bot (your bot must be able to download the MEGA creds JSON and restore session).

Keep .env secret. Add .gitignore with .env and sessions/ and db.json.

Baileys pairing flow may change; keep package updated.

MEGA upload uses your account — ensure adequate storage.

For production, add authentication (API key) on /pair so strangers cannot generate pair codes using your server and MEGA account.

Next steps I can do for you (pick any)

I can produce a zip file of this project you can download.

I can modify the code to return shortened Sila~ codes in another format (e.g., HMAC or expiry + signature).

I can add simple API-key auth middleware on /pair.

I can prepare a ready-to-deploy GitHub repo (I will give commands to create it locally).
